    "This notebook parses Form-13 data from SEC EDGAR. This is partially structured data, a mix of text and XML.  Instead of spending our time writing a bespoke parser to extract data from these files and load into Neo4j, we can prompt a Large Language Model (LLM) to do this for us automatically.  We will then also use the LLM to generate Cypher statements to load the extracted data into a Neo4j graph.\n",

To do that, go to the \"Kernel\" menu and click \"Restart Kernel and Clear All Outputs.\"  That will get rid of everything the install statements printed, leaving us with a cleaner notebook to work with."
